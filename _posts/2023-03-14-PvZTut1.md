# Introduction

Hello! Here, I'll show you how to combine PvZ images that have seperate files for masks into one image, for easier editing!

To start, you need to extract your PvZ files if you haven't already. You can do that with [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1030904713736110191/1066022952467968110/Plants_vs_Zombies_main.pak_Patcherer.exe) tool.

Additionally, you need the photo editor [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/).

# Step 1

To start, open GIMP. Once you do so, you should be greeted with this screen:

In the top left, we want to click *File > Open...*

The photo should now be imported and it will look like this:

# Step 2

Now that we have the photo imported, next we want to click *Layer > Mask > Add Layer mask...*

A window should open up, we now want to click *White (Full Opacity) > Add*

![photo7](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1004911792423718983/1085251355356180531/image.png)

We now want to right click *here*:

A menu should show up, but we only need to worry about these options *here*:

Enable *Show Layer Mask*

# Step 3

Now that we've added a layer mask, we need to add the second file as the mask. To do this, go to *File > Open as Layers...*

Now, we want to import the mask file. To do this, go to your PvZ folder and open the *PvZ_Logo_.png* file.
