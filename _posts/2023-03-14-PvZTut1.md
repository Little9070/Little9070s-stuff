To start, you need to extract your PvZ files if you haven't already. You can do that with [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1030904713736110191/1066022952467968110/Plants_vs_Zombies_main.pak_Patcherer.exe) tool.

Additionally, you need the photo editor [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/).

# Step 1

To start, open GIMP. Once you do so, you should be greeted with this screen:

The photo should now be imported and it will look like this:
